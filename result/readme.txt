*******Welcome to Puyo Puyo*******

Controls:

Left button - to push pair of puyos to the left

Right button - to push pair of puyos to the right

Down button - to force falling down pair of puyos

"Q" button - to rotate on clockwise

"W" button - to rotate against clockwise 



The game has two unsolved problems:

- if spheres make crossroads while making chain they will blow up (but not all of them)

- temporarily the is no chance to rotate pair of puyos in 360 degrees


In future:

- All problems will be solved.

- Logic of rotating pair of puyo will be changed.

- There will be added score system.

- Different sizes of game field.

- There will be an opportunity to change speed of falling.

- Bonus system. (if the player will blow up puyos more than one color, he will get a chance
	to choose color of next pair of puyos one time)
